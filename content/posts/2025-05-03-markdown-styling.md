##  Who We Are  
DeyWeaver = **AI + Open Source + Zero Cost**.  
We build **AI-powered productivity tools** for **students, techies, and pros**. Everything is **100% free** – even if cloud bills hate us.  

We also **research AI** and publish findings openly, because knowledge should flow free.

##  What Makes Us Different?
-  **Free. Forever.** No paywalls. No tricks.  
-  **MIT License** → Fork it, remix it, ship it.  
-  **Cool Projects + Ethical AI Research** that actually matters.
